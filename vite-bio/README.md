## ⚙️ React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template due to its impact on dev & build performance. To add it, see [React Compiler Installation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## 📏 ESLint Configuration

For production-grade apps, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. Explore the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for advanced setup.
