## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
```bash
npm install
npm run dev

#### 3. **Move Deployment Notes to Wiki or Docs**
The Netlify deployment steps and branding checklist are great—but they’re more for you than your visitors. You can:
- Move them to a `docs/deployment.md` file, or
- Keep them in a private Notion/Obsidian note
- Or comment them out in the README using HTML:
```html
<!--
## Deploy to Netlify
- Push your final code to GitHub
...
-->
#### 2. **Deploy to Netlify**
- Push your final code to GitHub
- Connect repo to Netlify
- Set build command: `npm run build` or `vite build`
- Set publish directory: `dist/` or `build/`
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

#### 3. **Group Repos**
- Go to each repo → Settings → Add topics:
  - `frontend`, `fullstack`, `API-based`
- Update README titles to reflect type

#### 4. **Add Branding**
- Update homepage with:
  - Short bio: “Aspiring fullstack dev building secure, responsive web apps”
  - Favicon: Add to `/public` and link in `index.html`
  - Custom title: `<title>Aswan Jay | Portfolio</title>`
